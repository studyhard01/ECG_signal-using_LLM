# Leveraging Language Models for Binary Classification of ECG Signal

## Introduction
This repository is using structure of **PromptCast: A New Prompt-based Learning Paradigm for Time Series Forecasting** (TKDE2023).  
  
using PTB-XL, we've tried to analyze ECG signal using pretrained language models such as BART, T5, LED.

## Requirements
python <= 3.7  

transformers == 4.17.0  

torch == 1.10.2  

setuptools==59.5.0
